# Write a Compiler - Preparation Exercises

The following exercises are meant as a bit of warmup for the compiler
project. Don't spend tons of time on these, but coding a solution will
start to prepare you for the proper mindset.

The `warmup` directory contains files you can use to help work on this
as well as some solution code if you get stuck.

## Exercise 1: Tokenizing

As input, a compiler needs to read source code.  To do this, it first
has to recognize certain patterns in the code such as names, number,
operators, and so forth.  This step is known as tokenizing.  Implement
the following `tokenize()` function.  It takes a string as input and
produces a sequence of tuples of the form `(toktype, value)` where
`toktype` is a token type and `value` is a string of the matching
text:

```
def tokenize(text):
    ...

assert list(tokenize("spam = x + 34 * 567")) == \
    [ ('NAME', 'spam'), ('ASSIGN', '='), ('NAME', 'x'), 
      ('OP', '+'), ('NUM', '34'),('OP', '*'), ('NUM', '567')]
```

If using a language other than Python, you should be able to
adapt the above test.

Regardless of the language used, there is a certain amount of
messiness involving string manipulation that you'll need to
resolve in the project.

## Exercise 2: Trees

Inside a compiler, source code is usually represented as a tree
structure.  Trees are usually recursive in nature--as are the algorithms
for dealing with the data.   The following tree represents source code
in the form of an "S-expression."   It's built using tuples.

```
tree = ('assign', 'spam', 
        ('binop', '+', 
                  ('name', 'x'),
                  ('binop', '*',
		            ('num', '34'),
			    ('num', '567'))))
```

Your task is to take this tree and turn it into a fragment of valid Python
code.  Specifically, you need to write a function `to_source()` that works
like this:

```
def to_source(tree):
    ... # you define

assert to_source(tree) == 'spam = x + 34 * 567'
```

Major parts of the compiler project involve walking over a tree structure
and carrying out some kind of processing.  This exercise will give you a bit
of practice.

## Exercise 3: Tree rewriting

Write a function that takes a tree of text strings as input and
creates a new tree where all of the numbers have been converted
from strings into integers:

```
def convert_numbers(tree):
    ...

tree = ('assign', 'spam', 
        ('binop', '+', 
                  ('name', 'x'),
                  ('binop', '*', ('num', '34'), ('num', '567'))))

assert convert_numbers(tree) == \
    ('assign', 'spam', ('binop', '+', ('name', 'x'), ('binop', '*', ('num', 34), ('num', 567))))    
```

Note: In this exercise, you will be constructing an entirely new tree.  The conversion of
numbers is not a mutation of existing data (i.e., you aren't converting the numbers
"in place"). 

## Exercise 4: Tree simplification

Write a function that takes a tree and looks for places where mathematical
operations can be carried out and simplified. A new simplified tree is returned:

```
def simplify_tree(tree):
    ...

tree = ('assign', 'spam', 
        ('binop', '+', 
                  ('name', 'x'),
                  ('binop', '*', ('num', 34), ('num', 567))))

assert simplify_tree(tree) == \
    ('assign', 'spam', ('binop', '+', ('name', 'x'), ('num', 19278)))
```

Big picture: The simplification of the tree is somewhat similar to
"algebraic simplification" that you probably encountered while taking
an Algebra class in school.  Compilers work on a similar principle--any
program can be replaced by a "different" program as long as the
final meaning/output of the program doesn't change.
